# Concurrent Mode

## A chain of unfortunate consequences

</L.Column>

<Background />

### How does React "delay" rendering?

---

<L.Column>

## Sources of Slowdown

- Slow component render functions
- Slow state setter or reducer updater functions
- Slow effect functions

</L.Column>

import DeferredSetState from '../assets/deferred-setstate.svg';

<L.Row>

## Deferred setState.

### Any state setter or dispatch can be delayed.

</L.Row>

<DeferredSetState />

import InterruptRendering from '../assets/interrupt-rendering.svg';

<L.Row>

## Interrupt Rendering.

### Any rendering can be interrupted and can be completed later before committing.

</L.Row>

<InterruptRendering />

---

<L.Row>

## Oops #1

### Delaying rendering is only safe when no effects are pending on a subtree.

</L.Row>

## The Hooks API.

### This restriction is reflected in the hooks API with encapsulation of effects.

## Hooks Timings.

### With each hook we observe a part of the lifecycle and can react.

import ComponentLifecycle from '../assets/component-lifecycle.svg';

<L.Row>

## The Lifecycle.

### The lifecycle we observe has three phases repeating.

</L.Row>

<ComponentLifecycle />

---

import ObservingLifecycleEvents from '../assets/observing-lifecycle-events.svg';

<L.Row>

## Observing the Lifecycle.

### Overlapping the lifecycle with hooks, we see a phase that we can't observe...

import InterruptedLifecycle from '../assets/interrupted-lifecycle.svg';

<L.Row>

## Interrupting the Lifecycle.

### Unfortunately this phase becomes very relevant in Strict and Concurrent Mode.

</L.Row>

<InterruptedLifecycle />

---

<L.Row>

## Oops #2

### It's not possible to have a subscription or effect track the component lifecycle.

</L.Row>

---

<L.Row>

## Workaround

### Resort to useSubscription

</L.Row>

import SchedulerPriorities from '../assets/scheduler-priorities.svg';

<L.Row>

## Scheduler Priorities.

### In Concurrent Mode the time budgets are switched on for time slicing.

</L.Row>

<SchedulerPriorities />

<L.Row>

## Oops #3

### Seems like React isn't all that predictable anymore.

</L.Row>

<L.Row>

## Workaround

### Synchronous Subscriber and scheduled teardown

<Background />

### "We didn't yet get to what happens when an effect is slow, right?"

---

<L.Row>

## Tearing

### "When a subtree's renderered state falls behind while another subtree has committed updates already."

</L.Row>

---

import Tearing1 from '../assets/bvaughn-tearing-1.png';
import Tearing2 from '../assets/bvaughn-tearing-2.png';

<L.Row>

<img src={Tearing1} />
</L.Row>

---

<L.Column>

## React's solution?

- When an effect slows down, React can't safely interrupt or delay updates.
- Instead it batches all updates and switches back to blocking mode
- This is called a _deopt_.

</L.Column>

---

<L.Row>

## Oops #4

### React Concurrent's deopt can be slower than Blocking was before.

</L.Row>

---

<L.Column>

## However

- This may still cause _tearing_ when another update is scheduled during this blocking batch.

</L.Column>

---

<L.Row>

## Oops #5

### A new `useMutableSource` hook is necessary to fix this tearing-during-deopt issue.

</L.Row>
